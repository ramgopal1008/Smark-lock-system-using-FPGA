# Smark-lock-system-using-FPGA
This project implements a secure digital locking system using Verilog HDL. It features a 4-bit password-based lock with input debouncing, state-machine-based control, and password change support. The design ensures reliable operation on real hardware, including FPGAs, by handling button press noise through debounce logic.
